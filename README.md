#### Brief Description of Project - In the pharmacy, a manual system is now in use. As the pharmacist's workload rises, this typically 
results in blunders. Our pharmacy management system is intended to boost efficiency and safety 
while also improving accuracy. It is a computer-based method that benefits both the customer and 
the pharmacist. For a set period of time, such as once a month, the system requires manual entry 
for the arrival of new batches of medications and for the transportation of medications out of the 
pharmacy. The flow of medications into and out of the pharmacy, the list of stock ending 
information, and a list of products that expire after a certain date before the product ultimately 
expires are also included in the report. The system has the ability to send SMS and emails. After 
creating an account, clients can access the system's stock availability information and upload a 
prescription. They can view the status of their uploading by logging onto the system and place 
orders according their needs for medicine. Pharmacist can generate reports of the stock and sales 
for a time period easily by our pharmacy management system.

#### Technologies used - Mern Stack(MongoDB,React js,Node Js,Express js)
